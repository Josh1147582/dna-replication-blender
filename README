These are the source files to my AP Bio Final Project - a recreation of DNA replication in Blender.

Each file is a different part of the process. These pieces are strung together in the final video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ4KZC5QotE

Hopefully these can help someone learn a bit about Blender!
